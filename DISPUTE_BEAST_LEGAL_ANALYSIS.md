4. **Must provide written contracts**

## 🔍 Key Legal Language from Terms of Service

### **Service Definition:**
> "(j) 'Services' means the **software-as-a-service offering** described in the Order Form."

**Translation:** They position themselves as a SaaS company, not a credit repair organization.

### **Rights Disclaimer:**
> "Rights Regarding Consumer Credit Files Under State and Federal Law: Individuals have the right to challenge any inaccuracies found within their credit reports by directly engaging with the credit bureau. While this right is recognized, neither individuals nor 'credit repair' entities or organizations possess the right to remove accurate, current, and verifiable information from a credit report."

**Translation:** They educate users that THEY (the user) are doing the credit repair, not Dispute Beast.

### **No Refunds Clause:**
> "Credits are applicable only toward future fees for use of the Services and are not convertible into cash. The fees for the Services and the Credits are not refundable under any circumstances."

**Translation:** Subscription model with no refunds (except 110% guarantee after 1 year).

## ✅ Conclusion

Dispute Beast's strategy is **brilliant and legally sound**. They've successfully navigated CROA by:

1. Charging for "credit monitoring" (allowed)
2. Providing "free dispute software" (included feature)
3. Positioning as "DIY tools" (user does the work)
4. Offering education and training (not credit repair service)

**Our adaptation should:**
- Offer better pricing ($29-79 one-time + $39.99/month)
- Provide superior letters (litigation-grade vs generic)
- Emphasize cross-bureau conflict detection (our secret weapon)
- Bundle education + software + monitoring

**This positions us as a BETTER, CHEAPER alternative to Dispute Beast while maintaining full CROA compliance.**
