# IdentityIQ Affiliate Revenue Projections

## Commission Structure (Confirmed)

**One-time Commission:** Up to $40 per qualified enrollment  
**Cookie Duration:** 30 days  
**Residual Monthly:** NOT CONFIRMED (need to verify with IDIQ directly)

**Important Note:** The research shows $40 per referral, but DisputeBeast mentioned "residual monthly commissions." We need to clarify if IdentityIQ offers:
1. Just $40 one-time per signup, OR
2. $40 upfront + monthly residual

## Revenue Scenarios (Conservative: $40 One-Time Only)

### Scenario 1: 100 New Signups/Month
- **Monthly Revenue:** 100 × $40 = **$4,000**
- **Annual Revenue:** $4,000 × 12 = **$48,000**

### Scenario 2: 500 New Signups/Month  
- **Monthly Revenue:** 500 × $40 = **$20,000**
- **Annual Revenue:** $20,000 × 12 = **$240,000**

### Scenario 3: 1,000 New Signups/Month
- **Monthly Revenue:** 1,000 × $40 = **$40,000**
- **Annual Revenue:** $40,000 × 12 = **$480,000**

|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| 100           | $48,000                | $126,000               | +$78,000   |
| 500           | $240,000               | $630,000               | +$390,000  |
| 1,000         | $480,000               | $1,260,000             | +$780,000  |

**The residual model is 2.6x more profitable!**
