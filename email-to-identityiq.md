Dear IdentityIQ Sales Team,

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I'm the founder of **DisputeStrike**, an AI-powered credit repair platform that helps consumers dispute negative accounts on their credit reports through automated dispute letter generation.

We're currently evaluating credit monitoring partners to integrate with our platform, and IdentityIQ's comprehensive 3-bureau monitoring and identity theft protection services align perfectly with our mission to help consumers improve their financial health.

I'm interested in joining your affiliate program and have a few questions about the partnership structure:

## 1. Commission Structure
I understand the affiliate program offers up to $40 per qualified enrollment. Could you clarify:
- Is this a one-time commission per signup, or does it include residual monthly commissions for active subscribers?
- If residual commissions are available, what is the monthly rate per active user?
- Are there performance tiers or volume bonuses for high-performing affiliates?

## 2. White-Label API Access
For seamless user experience, we'd like to integrate IdentityIQ's credit monitoring data directly into our platform rather than redirecting users to an external site. 
- Do you offer white-label or API access for affiliate partners?
- If so, what endpoints are available (credit reports, scores, monitoring alerts, etc.)?
- What are the technical requirements and costs associated with API integration?

## 3. Partnership Details
- What is the typical monthly subscription price users pay for IdentityIQ services?
- What is the average customer retention rate or churn rate?
- Are there any minimum volume requirements or exclusivity clauses?

## About DisputeStrike
Our platform uses advanced AI to analyze credit reports and generate litigation-grade dispute letters that comply with FCRA, FDCPA, and FCBA regulations. We're targeting the $14 billion credit repair industry with a modern, automated solution.

**Our projected user acquisition:**
- Month 1-3: 50-100 new users/month
- Month 4-6: 150-300 new users/month
- Month 7-12: 300-500+ new users/month

We believe a partnership with IdentityIQ would be mutually beneficial, providing our users with trusted credit monitoring while driving qualified enrollments to your platform.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss this partnership further. Would you be available for a brief call this week to explore how we can work together?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

[YOUR NAME]

## Alternative: Shorter Version

Hi IdentityIQ Team,

I'm building **DisputeStrike**, an AI-powered credit repair platform, and I'm interested in partnering with IdentityIQ as our credit monitoring provider.

I have three quick questions about your affiliate program:

1. **Residual Commissions:** Does the program offer monthly recurring commissions, or just the $40 one-time per enrollment?

2. **API Access:** Do you provide white-label API access so we can integrate credit monitoring data directly into our platform?

3. **Pricing:** What is the typical monthly subscription cost for IdentityIQ users?

We're projecting 100-500 new users per month and believe IdentityIQ would be a great fit for our audience.

Would love to discuss partnership opportunities. Are you available for a quick call this week?

Thanks,
