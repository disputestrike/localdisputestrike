# Cross-Bureau Conflicts: Why Your Credit Reports Don't Match (And How to Fix It)

Have you ever noticed that your credit score is different on Experian than it is on TransUnion? While small score variations are normal, **conflicting data** between the bureaus is a major red flag—and a massive opportunity for you to fix your credit.

## What are Cross-Bureau Conflicts?

A cross-bureau conflict occurs when the three major credit bureaus report different information for the exact same account. For example:
*   **Experian** says your balance is $500.
*   **TransUnion** says your balance is $750.
*   **Equifax** says the account is closed.

Under the **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**, credit bureaus are required to report information with "maximum possible accuracy." If they are reporting different numbers for the same debt, at least two of them are wrong.

## The "Maximum Possible Accuracy" Rule

FCRA § 1681e(b) states that credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information. 

When DisputeStrike's AI detects a cross-bureau conflict, it uses this as a primary argument for deletion. If the bureaus cannot agree on the facts of the debt, the debt is **unverifiable** by definition.

## Why Traditional Credit Repair Misses This

Most traditional credit repair companies look at each bureau in a vacuum. They dispute Experian items on an Experian letter and TransUnion items on a TransUnion letter. 

**DisputeStrike is different.** Our AI performs a "tri-merge" analysis, comparing all three reports simultaneously to find these hidden conflicts. We then use that conflicting data as leverage to force the bureaus to delete the inaccurate tradelines.

## How to Spot Conflicts on Your Report

Look for discrepancies in:
1.  **Date of Last Activity:** This should be identical across all bureaus.
2.  **Account Status:** One bureau shouldn't show "Charge-off" while another shows "Late."
3.  **High Balance:** The highest amount ever owed should be consistent.

## Take Action Today

Conflicting data is one of the most effective ways to get negative items removed from your credit report. Don't let the bureaus report inaccurate information that holds you back.
