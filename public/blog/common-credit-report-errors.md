# 5 Common Credit Report Errors That Are Lowering Your Score

Did you know that according to a study by the FTC, **one in five consumers** has an error on at least one of their credit reports? These errors aren't just annoying—they can cost you thousands of dollars in higher interest rates or even cause you to be denied for a home or car loan.

Here are the five most common credit report errors you need to watch out for:

## 1. Identity Errors
This is the most common type of error. It happens when information belonging to someone with a similar name or Social Security number is mixed into your file. This is often called a "merged file."

## 2. Incorrect Account Status
Sometimes, an account you closed is still reported as open, or a debt you've already paid off is still showing a balance. Even worse, an account might be incorrectly marked as "Charge-off" or "In Collections" when it was actually paid on time.

## 3. Data Management Errors
These are technical glitches where the same debt is listed multiple times (double reporting) or where an account that was removed after a dispute suddenly reappears (reinsertion).

## 4. Outdated Information
Negative information, such as late payments or collections, generally must be removed after **seven years**. Bankruptcies must be removed after ten. If you see old "zombie" debts on your report, they are violating the law.

## 5. Impossible Timelines
This is a favorite for DisputeStrike's AI. We often find accounts where the "Date of Last Activity" is reported as occurring *before* the account was even opened. This is a clear sign of inaccurate data reporting.

## How to Fix These Errors

The good news is that you have the legal right to have these errors corrected or deleted under the **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**. 

DisputeStrike makes this process easy. Our AI scans your report for all five of these error types (and many more) and generates the exact legal letters you need to send to the bureaus to get them fixed.
