# Pricing Page Design Notes

## Current Design Elements (Good)
- White background with clean layout
- "$1 for 7 days" badge at top
- "Choose Your Plan" heading
- Two side-by-side pricing cards
- DIY $49.99/mo on left
- Complete $79.99/mo on right (with "MOST POPULAR" badge)
- Feature lists with checkmarks
- Comparison table below
- FAQ section
- Final CTA at bottom

## What User Wants
- Trial checkout should show these pricing tiers clearly
- User selects which plan they want
- Then fills out form to start $1 trial
- NOT just a form - needs to see the pricing options first
