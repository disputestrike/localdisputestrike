# Plan vs Current – Command Center (Blueprint v2.0)

## Sidebar ✅ DONE
| Plan | Current |
|------|---------|
| MISSION CONTROL: Dashboard, My Live Report, Dispute Manager, Mailing Tracker | ✅ Same |
| ADVANCED TACTICS: Inquiry Removal, Debt Validation, CFPB (Round 3), Creditor Disputes | ✅ Same |
| CREDIT BUILDING: Score Simulator, Marketplace | ✅ Same |
| Remove Profile Optimizer, Referrals | ✅ Removed |
| Upload / Refresh reports always available | ✅ In nav |

## Main Dashboard (was “only side fixed”) – NOW UPDATED

### Identity Header ✅ ADDED
| Plan | Current |
|------|---------|
| “Scoreboard”: TU / EQ / EX scores, Potential delta, AI Strategist | ✅ **Command Center** card: scores placeholder (— / — / —), potential delta, AI Strategist blurb |
| Financial War Room feel | ✅ Gradient, orange accent, “Command Center” title |

### Don’t Lead with Upload ✅ DONE
| Plan | Current |
|------|---------|
| Dashboard ≠ “file uploader”; Upload = fallback | ✅ **Mission** tab is **default** (not Upload) |
| Overview / Mission first | ✅ **Mission** tab: “Your mission”, quick actions (Upload, My Live Report, Dispute Manager) |
| Upload secondary | ✅ Upload is one of three CTAs in Mission; full upload UI in **Upload** tab |

### Progress + Tabs
| Plan | Current |
|------|---------|
| Progress steps (Upload → Review → Letters → Mail) | ✅ Unchanged, below Identity Header |
| Mission Control–aligned tabs | ✅ Mission (default), Upload, Accounts, Letters, Tracking, Score, Compare, Progress, Documents |

## Still To Do (per plan)
- **Live Credit Report**: Interactive view, AI-highlighted violations, “Why” tooltip (Source Bible + FCRA). *Requires parsed report UI.*
- **Real triple scores + Potential**: SmartCredit (or similar) integration.
- **Identity Bridge**: Full modal (SSN, DOB, Exhibit A/B) before “Generate My Letters”.
- **Lob / mailing**: Complete tier automated certified mail.

## Summary
- **Sidebar:** Matches plan.
- **Main dashboard:** Identity Header + Mission-as-default + Upload as secondary CTA are in place. No longer “only side fixed.”
