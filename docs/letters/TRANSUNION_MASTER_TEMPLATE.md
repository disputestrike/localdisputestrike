# TransUnion Master Letter Template (Reference)

**Source:** User-provided TransUnion dispute letter (Dec 29, 2025). Same structure as [Experian](EXPERIAN_MASTER_TEMPLATE.md). Mirror for Equifax.

## Bureau-Specific

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Bureau** | TransUnion Consumer Solutions |
| **Address** | P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016-2000 |
| **"What other bureaus report"** | Cite **Experian** and **Equifax** (letter is TO TransUnion) |

## Exhibit Order (when writing TO TransUnion)

- **Exhibit C:** TransUnion Credit Report (disputed accounts)
- **Exhibit D:** Equifax Credit Report (conflicts with TU)
- **Exhibit E:** Experian Credit Report (conflicts with TU)
- **Exhibit F+:** Other (e.g. Declaration of Account Surrender)

Exhibits A (ID) and B (Utility) are unchanged.

## 30-Day Rule

Same as Experian. All demands use **30 days**. The original TU letter used "within 15 days" for Account 1 (Pro Collect); **our implementation uses 30-day only.**

## Structure

Identical to Experian: Header → Address/Name Verification → I. Legal Basis → II. Cross-Bureau Conflicts → III. Account-by-Account (TU’s data vs EX/EQ) → IV. Accounts That Should Not Report Negatively → V. Summary → VI. Legal Requirements & Timeline (30 days) → VII. Exhibits → VIII. Consequences → IX. Required Response → Contact → FINAL NOTICE (30 days) → Enclosures.
