## Bureau-Specific

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Bureau** | Equifax Information Services LLC |
| **Address** | P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374-0256 |
| **"What other bureaus report"** | Cite **Experian** and **TransUnion** (letter is TO Equifax) |

## Exhibit Order (when writing TO Equifax)

- **Exhibit C:** Equifax Credit Report (disputed accounts)
- **Exhibit D:** Experian Credit Report (conflicts with Equifax)
- **Exhibit E:** TransUnion Credit Report (conflicts with Equifax)
- **Exhibit F+:** Other (e.g. Declaration of Account Surrender)

Exhibits A (ID) and B (Utility) are unchanged.

## 30-Day Rule

Same as Experian and TransUnion. All demands use **30 days**. The original Equifax letter used "within 15 days" for Account 1 (Procollect Inc.); **our implementation uses 30-day only.**

## Structure

Identical to Experian/TransUnion: Header → Address/Name Verification → I. Legal Basis → II. Cross-Bureau Conflicts → III. Account-by-Account (Equifax’s data vs EX/TU) → IV. Accounts That Should Not Report Negatively → V. Summary → VI. Legal Requirements & Timeline (30 days) → VII. Exhibits → VIII. Consequences → IX. Required Response → Contact → FINAL NOTICE (30 days) → Enclosures.
