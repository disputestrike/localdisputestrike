# Dispute Letter Format Reference (from user examples)

Based on FINAL_TRANSUNION_LETTER, FINAL_EQUIFAX_LETTER, FINAL_EXPERIAN_LETTER examples.

## One letter per bureau = ALL errors for that bureau

- **TransUnion letter**: Include every negative account that appears on TransUnion.
- **Equifax letter**: Include every negative account that appears on Equifax.
- **Experian letter**: Include every negative account that appears on Experian.

No “one error per letter”—each bureau gets one letter listing all disputed items for that bureau.
